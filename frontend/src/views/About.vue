    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm <a href="https://rsseau.fr">Alexandre</a>. I'm a french software engineer passionate about Open-Source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Open source software is everywhere but lot's of projects lack of ressources. Big company use small
      librairies who need sponsors but theses libraries are not well-known and nobody put money into them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main purpose of this projects is to offer a way for companies (or sponsors) to give some money to theses
      projects. Instead to give to well-known projects, the sponsors will choose some criteria to support projects (like
      <a href="https://github.com/topics">Github Topics</a>, number of stars). For instance, a sponsor can choose to
      give money for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "<a href="https://github.com/topics/open-data">Open Data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/topics/api"
          >API</a
        >
        about <a href="https://github.com/topics/covid-19">COVID-19</a> with at least 20 stars"
      </li>
      <li>
        "<a href="https://github.com/topics/firmware">Firmware</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a
          href="https://github.com/topics/linux"
          >Linux</a
        >&nbsp;desktop"
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For theses companies, is an excellent way to gain some exposure and show his love for Open-Source.</p>
